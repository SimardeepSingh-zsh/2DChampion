# 2DChampion
Welcome to the 2DChampion Game Development Repository! This is a public repository where developers can contribute to the development of 2D games that will be featured on the 2DChampion website.

## Getting Started

To get started with contributing to the repository, you should first clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
https://github.com/rishibaghel25/2DChampion.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, you can create a new branch to work on your changes:

```bash

```

From there, you can make your changes and commit them to your branch. When you are ready to submit your changes for review, you can create a pull request and the project maintainers will review your changes.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels! If you are new to open source or game development, don't worry â€“ we are here to help. Here are some ways you can contribute:

  -  Develop new 2D games
  -  Improve existing 2D games
  -  Fix bugs and issues
  -  Add new features

## Adding 2D Games
If you'd like to contribute a 2D game, you can create a new folder for your game within the repository. Your game should be developed using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript, as our website is built on the Angular framework. You can refer to existing games in the repository for inspiration and examples.

### To add your game:

- Create a new folder for your game within the repository.
- Develop your game using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.
- Include any necessary assets within your game's folder.
- Update this README to showcase your game, including screenshots or GIFs.
- Create a pull request to submit your game for review.
